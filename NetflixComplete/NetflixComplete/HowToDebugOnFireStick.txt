Debugging my custom Netflix app on Amazon Firestick
DATE of this note: 7/26/2017
===============================================
1. Make sure the Firestick and the computer running this code are connected to the same network.
2. On the Firestick, go to Settings->Device->About->Network and write down or remember the IP Address.
3. On the Firestick, go to Settings->Device->Developer Options and ensure both ADB debugging and Apps from Unknown Sources are enabled.
   Note: ADB debugging allows you to connect to the Firestick remotely from your computer over TCP/IP. 
         Apps from Unknown Sources allows you to install apps that are NOT in the Android App Store on the Firestick.
4. Download and install adbLink.
5. Run adbLink.
6. If your Firestick is not listed as a Current device, click New. Otherwise, click Edit.
7. The IP address specified in the Address field should be the IP address from Step 2.
8. The port should be 5555. (Note: This allows you to connect to the Firestick via TCP/IP over port 5555).
9. Click Connect to connect the Firestick.
10. Within 30 seconds, the connected status should show Connected.
11. Amazon AFTM should now be listed as a device in Visual Studio. 
	Note: Make sure the NetflixComplete.DroidTV project is the active one.
	      If Amazon AFTM is not listed as a device, make sure you have the Google USB Driver package installed in Android SDK Manager.
12. Build and Deploy NetflixComplete.DroidTV to the device.

NOTE: If adbLink keeps saying its out of date or not working, it could be that there are two different versions of
      the adb.exe executable on your machine. adbLink could be using one adb.exe, and the Android SDK could be using another.
	  Copy the one from the Android SDK to the adbLink directory.
